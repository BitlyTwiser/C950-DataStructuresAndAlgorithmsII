# C195-DataStructuresAndAlgorithmsII
C950 project.Basically a variation of the traveling salesman problem

## Overview:
- Basically split this into a few parts.


## Coding: 2 parts
### Functinoality (loading data, data structures etc..) (You can modify the xlsx sheets and make them CSV's)
- Make a shash table from the ground up, no built in libraries.
- Keep track of your packages. (Miliage and when they were delivered)
- User interface (cli to query data)
- Add comment at each block denoting the time complexity

### optimization (algorithms):
- Do not use Dykstras
- how to load the trucks and which packages go into the truck
- 16 is max per truck
- use greedy algorithm
- Delivery of packages is self adusting part of alrogithm
- Heuristics manualy loading trucks? Not sure here, just automate this.
- Make up your own algorithm for this item.

### The document:
- This seems to be returned often. 
- Do not use the overview as a template
- Use section headers, use the requirements as the section headers
